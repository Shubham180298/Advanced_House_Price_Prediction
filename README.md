## General Information
A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. We are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## Conclusions
- Lasso Regression gives the best result.
- We obtaina r2 value of around 0.89 for train and test.
- The top predictors are GrLivArea, OverallCond and OverallQual.





## Technologies Used
- Python
